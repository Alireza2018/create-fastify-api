  <summary>🖥 API Framework:</em> <a href=""><b>Fastify</b></a> - <em>a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs.</em></summary><br>
  
  We needed a web framework to support developer productivity and high execution performance in node.js.

We checked out the [Techempower Web Framework Benchmarks for node.js](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r19&hw=cl&test=fortune&l=zik0sf-1p) and
saw a few high-performing web frameworks. Based on this, we manually reviewed the top performers from a developer experience perspecitve. We found that FastAPI was
the framework with the highest overall value to support developer productivity and execution performance.

# Sponsored by Sci-Code

_Bridging the gap between education and industry._

Sci-Code is actively developing services, tools and technologies that contribute towards closing the gap between industry and education. The motivation and value upon which the Company has been built is usefulness. The key of any country’s societal development is based on Education. It is how a generation of people pass its knowledge, know-how and values to the next one.

This is why we're working to accelerate the advent of a new education system, pillared on the advances in technology that will enable exploratory learning, personalized learning experiences tailored to each individual, and the most stimulating education in the world; verified by our algorithms. This system will serve as an alternative to the current education system, allowing for a seamless and gradual, piece-by-piece transition. And through building this new system, we allow for the change of our current societal dogma of school and learning being perceived as necessarily boring and hard, into school and learning being awesome.
